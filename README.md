The project requires Python 3 to import flashcards. To setup the environment for the project, run:
```bash
make setup
```

To import flashcards, pull a CSV in [this format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wntkF6W-mNdyTxaEZI-RmvvdGeeDKY8iq9FHbYhtNog/edit?usp=sharing).
Then, import the flashcards by running a target such as:
```bash
make asl-101-flashcards
```
